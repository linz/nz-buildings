-- Script to compare all new (most recent bulk load) outlines to the
-- existing outlines that intersect with the new outlines' capture source
-- area. The outlines are sorted into four categories:

-- added: new outlines not intersecting with any existing
-- removed: existing outlines not intersecting with any new
-- matched: new and existing outlines 1:1 match
-- related: more complex relationships between new and existing outlines
--          such as 1:many or many:1 or many:many
